Description: This library is a Python/C++ implementation of the algorithms
described in Fan, Z. and Mackey, L. ``An Empirical Bayesian Analysis of
Simultaneous Changepoints in Multiple Data Sequences''.

INSTALL
------------------------------------------------
This package requires a working installation of Python 2.7, numpy, and
matplotlib. From a terminal, cd to the pylib subdirectory and execute

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

To test your installation, cd to the pylib/test subdirectory and execute

  python test.py

This will test all of the implemented likelihood model and plot simulated data
with detected changepoints.

To install to a local directory (e.g. if you do not have administrative access
to the default install location), cd to the pylib subdirectory and execute

  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install --prefix=<YOUR-INSTALL-LOCATION>

where <YOUR-INSTALL-LOCATION> should be replaced by a local installation
directory. Ensure that <YOUR-INSTALL-LOCATION>/lib/python2.7/site-packages is
added to your PYTHONPATH environment variable (e.g. by adding the line

  export PYTHONPATH=<YOUR-INSTALL-LOCATION>/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

to your .bashrc or equivalent file).

The installation assumes that the default C++ compiler used by Python has
C++-11 support. The compiler may be manually set within the setup.py file by
adding the lines

  import os
  os.environ["CXX"] = <YOUR-C++-COMPILER>


USAGE
------------------------------------------------------
To read a CSV-formatted data matrix 'X.csv' (with rows indexing sequences and
columns indexing sequential positions/time points) into Python:

  import numpy
  X = numpy.loadtxt('X.csv', delimiter=',')
  (J,T) = X.shape

To draw 200 samples of changepoint locations using MCMC and estimate
changepoint model parameters using MCEM (assuming a Gaussian observation model
with changing mean and fixed variance):

  import BASIC_changepoint as BASIC
  [samples, model_params, pi_q, q_vals] = BASIC.MCMC_sample(X, 'normal_mean',
        sample_iters=200, MCEM_schedule=[10,20,40,60,100])

To obtain a posterior mode point-estimate of changepoints, using the
MCMC-estimated posterior mean rounded to 0--1 as an initial guess:

  chg_probs = BASIC.marginal_change_probs(samples[100:], J, T)
  mode = BASIC.compute_posterior_mode(X, 'normal_mean', model_params, pi_q,
        q_vals, Z=(chg_probs>0.5))

To plot the first four sequences in X with their detected changepoints:

  fig = BASIC.plot_changes(X, mode, seqs=[0,1,2,3])
  fig.show()

To save the MCMC sampling output to a (compressed) file 'MCMC_out.pkl' on disk,
and to read it back from disk:

  import cPickle
  cPickle.dump([samples, model_params, pi_q, q_vals], open('MCMC_out.pkl','w'))
  [samples, model_params, pi_q, q_vals] = cPickle.load(open('MCMC_out.pkl','r'))

To convert the posterior mode point-estimate to a binary 0--1 matrix of
changepoint indicator variables and save it to a CSV-formatted text file
'Z_mode.csv':

  Z = BASIC.change_dict_to_Z_matrix(mode, J, T)
  numpy.savetxt('Z_mode.csv', Z, fmt='%d', delimiter=',')
